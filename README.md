# the-social-network
A social network created using MongoDB + Mongoose. Features users, friends, thoughts and reactions.

## Description

I was motivated to create this project as a means to learn more about Sequelize and Express.JS within a real life application. I built this app in order to better understand the data flow and the principles of CRUD. From there, I utilized Sequelize to perform queries of my data, eliminating the need for MySQL queries myself. Diving into Sequelize really saved me a lot of time and made working with the database very seamless. 

I was motivated to create this project to gain more insight and knowledge on using MongoDB to store data and Mongoose to interact with that data. I built this app in order to simulate a social network of user data and to see how that data can interact with each other. I really enjoyed this working on this application, creating the structure of the directory, building the models and into the routes + controllers. It was great to see it all come together and seeing the data pull into different arrays.

## Installation

The steps to install my project are as follows:

- Clone or fork my code from GitHub
- Install the required dependencies (Express Mongoose, Nodemon)
- Run "npm run seed" to insert the testing data into MongoDB
- Run the file from the command line using "npm run start"
- Use Postman or Insomnia to interact with the server, as this app is not live
- *Recommend* using Nodemon to restart your server automatically

## Usage
